        question: "How does the referral program work?",
        answer: "Our referral program lets you earn through direct sales and by inviting others to register under your account. There is no binary tree or multi-level structure—only direct referrals, with unlimited personal recruits."
      },
      {
        question: "How much money can I make?",
        answer: "Earnings depend on your activity and referrals. We do not guarantee any specific income or results. You can track your earnings and transactions inside your dashboard."
      },
      {
        question: "Is this a pyramid scheme?",
        answer: "We are a referral-based platform where users can earn from direct referrals based on the current plan rules shown in the app. Please review our policies and ensure participation is permitted in your region."
      },
      {
        question: "What countries do you operate in?",
        answer: "Availability depends on local regulations and our operational support. If registration is available in your region, you’ll be able to complete signup and payments normally."
      }
    ],
    account: [
      {
        question: "How do I create an account?",
        answer: "1) Click 'Join as Customer' or 'Join as Company', 2) Fill the registration form, 3) Verify via OTP (and email if enabled), 4) Choose and pay for your plan. You’ll then have access to your dashboard."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I change my sponsor/upline after registration?",
        answer: "No, sponsor relationships cannot be changed after account creation. This keeps the direct-referral structure consistent and fair. Please choose your sponsor carefully during registration."
      },
      {
        question: "What if I forget my password?",
        answer: "Use the 'Forgot Password' link on the login page. Enter your email address and follow the reset instructions. If you don’t receive the email, check spam/junk and try again."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I update my profile information?",
        answer: "Log into your dashboard and open your profile/account settings. Some fields may require verification before they can be changed."
      }
    ],
    payments: [
      {
        question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
        answer: "We currently accept cryptocurrency payments in USDT (BEP20 / Binance Smart Chain). You can pay using supported wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or SafePal."
      },
      {
        question: "When and how are commissions paid?",
        answer: "Earnings are credited to your wallet based on completed/verified payments and the current plan rules. You can view all credits and debits in your Transactions and Earnings sections."
      },
      {
        question: "Are there any fees for withdrawals?",
        answer: "Withdrawal fees (if any) depend on blockchain network costs and any platform processing rules shown at the time you request a withdrawal. Withdrawals are typically processed instantly after you submit a request."
      },
      {
        question: "What is your refund policy?",
        answer: "We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for new subscribers who have not earned any commissions. Refund requests must be submitted within 30 days of purchase. Refunds are processed within 5–10 business days, and processing/transaction fees may be deducted."
      }
    ],
    security: [
      {
        question: "How secure is my personal information?",
        answer: "We use standard security best practices such as encrypted connections and access controls. Always use a strong password and keep your account credentials private."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you offer two-factor authentication?",
        answer: "If OTP/2FA options are available in your account settings, we strongly recommend enabling them for extra protection."
      },
      {
        question: "What should I do if I suspect unauthorized access?",
        answer: "Change your password immediately and review your recent logins/transactions. If you see anything suspicious, contact support from the Contact page."
      },
      {
        question: "How do you protect against fraud?",
        answer: "We monitor for suspicious activity and may require additional verification in some cases. Never share OTPs, passwords, or private keys with anyone."

    technical: [
      {
        question: "What browsers are supported?",
        answer: "Our platform works best on modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. We recommend keeping your browser updated for optimal performance and security. Mobile browsers are also fully supported for on-the-go access."
      },
      {
        question: "Is there a mobile app available?",
        answer: "Currently, we offer a mobile-responsive website that works excellently on all devices. A dedicated mobile app is in development and will be available soon. You can add our website to your home screen for app-like functionality."
      },
      {
        question: "Why is my dashboard loading slowly?",
        answer: "Slow loading can be caused by internet connection, browser cache, or high server traffic. Try clearing your browser cache, checking your internet connection, or accessing during off-peak hours. Contact technical support if problems persist."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I report a technical bug?",
        answer: "Report bugs through the Contact page. Include your device/browser, steps to reproduce, and screenshots if possible."
